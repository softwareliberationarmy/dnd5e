TODO:
In React, if user enters a + or -, correct it before sending it
Review architecture so far and check for cohesiveness
	Open up Resharper architecture viewer
	Can we group all SQL Server work closer together?
Cleanup: Character ctor has too many arguments (consolidate abilities?)
Cleanup: Not happy with the repository unit tests. They test domain things because nothing is exposed
Consider adding Mediatr and CQRS so we can have an end-to-end test without exposing properties
Add AutoFixture to test project
Add logging
Add authentication (SQL Server storage for now)
Feature: authentication and associating characters with a login
Feature: starting hit points determined by character class
Feature: speed determined by race
Feature: on level-up, user hit points are updated based on character class
Epic: start adding race characteristics, broken out by race
Epic: start adding class characteristics, broken out by class
Feature: user can change character XP

MAYBE:
Rewrite repository to use MongoDb

DONE:
Add requested roll to roll result
Add simple react website 
+ is a reserved character for URLs
	- add IIS Express exception for this?
	- change it to a POST and pass as message body
	- change the character to something else (2d4p2)
	- make it a query argument instead
